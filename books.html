                            <strong>Law in Medicine or in short Law</strong>, one of the books Ibn Sina is in the field of medicine, which is claimed to have been taught for nearly seven hundred years in the scientific 
                            centers of Europe and after Holy Bible The second book that was published in Europe was Abu Ali Sina's Book of Laws. Even in the present era, it is claimed that it is taught 
                            as an important part of ancient medicine in the most important centers and universities of the world. The original of the book is written in Arabic 
                            language which was taught in Arabic for several hundred years and finally Abdul Rahman Sharafkandi translated it into Persian language in the 1340s and 1360s.
                            This book is the most important and detailed book of Ibn Sina in medicine and one of the most important medical books in civilization Iran after Islam and among the most 
                            important works of doctors of old world.The law should be considered as a scientific combination of Bu'Ali's clinical experiences, the works and teachings of Galen, Hippocrates, and Aristotle , and the writings of Iranian and Muslim doctors before him, such as Razi, <a href="https://fa.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D8%A7%D8%A8%D9%86_%D8%B1%D8%A8%D9%86" target="_blank">Ibn Raban Tabari</a>, and  <a href="https://fa.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D8%A7%D8%A8%D9%88%D8%B3%D9%87%D9%84_%D9%85%D8%B3%DB%8C%D8%AD%DB%8C" target="_blank">Abu Sahl the Christian</a>.
                            The Book of Laws is considered the greatest Galenian medical document, but Aristotelian theoretical issues dominate this valuable work. Bo Ali cited Aristotle in his explanation. He has explained the general principles of medicine based on the opinions of Galen, and his pharmacology based on the writings of Dioscorides (a famous Greek pharmacologist in the first century AD).
                            Bo Ali had an opinion on theoretical and practical medicine. In his medical works, especially in law , he has expressed practical and clinical teachings in the form of theoretical and scientific definitions. The clinical observations of the law can be compared with the clinical empirical concepts of al-Hawi . Ibn Sina did not consider Razi worthy of the name of doctor and sage, but he actually learned many of his treatment methods and experimental work from Al-Hawi Razi.

                        <strong>Al-Shiffa</strong> the most important and comprehensive work of Ibn Sina can be called an      encyclopedia in Arabic language, in intellectual sciences He calculated that in it the abstract of 
                        the opinions of the great ancient Greek philosophers and commentators of the school of Alexandria, Platonists and Neo-Platonists, etc., in all intellectual sciences, including logic, has 
                        been provided and has been subjected to scientific analysis and criticism. In the precious book Healing, the author was able to speak accurately and completely in all four parts of logic, 
                        mathematics, natural science and theology and provide the necessary information about each of these four noble sciences in an orderly manner.
                        Book Healing, includes natural techniques, logic, theology and mathematics; In this way, the topics of each science are divided into techniques, and the topics of each technique are divided 
                        into articles, and the topics of each article are divided into chapters, and in each chapter, the issues are examined with the patience and detail that is worthy of scientific works, without repetition and reprimands.
                        Ibn Sina's book Barhan Shafai discusses the formal rules of reasoning that guarantee the correctness of reasoning; But the discussion of the argument is not the discussion of the formal rules of reasoning without regard to the reality and the way reality exists. No formal law can be efficient and effective without being related to reality. By discussing the formal rules of reasoning, Burhan Shafa tells about the entanglement of human perceptive powers and deals with many different issues that have an epistemological nature and even speak of the philosophy of science. This book is a rich source of topics that are completely new after the passing of centuries and have the ability to contribute effectively to new epistemological issues.

                        treatise he left a great masterpiece, and now many of its contents are in line with current medical knowledge. A large number of medical terms can be seen in this treatise, which Ibn Sina gave their Persian 
                        equivalents. "Vaginology" is one of the components of Ibn Sina's book and as its name implies, it is about the pulse and the identification of veins. "Vaginology" is a treatise that was apparently written at 
                        the end of his life, because it contains different ideas from what he wrote in the book of Law of Medicine.Although veins and pi for nerves vertebrae and aeroids is used, but Ibn Sina himself sometimes mentioned 
                        it in this book as the place where the soul passes through. It should be kept in mind that the predecessors, following Galen, considered the pulse to be caused by wave movements (constant ) the veins knew, for this 
                        reason, in this book, the veins have the ability to move or have the movement of contraction and expansion.
