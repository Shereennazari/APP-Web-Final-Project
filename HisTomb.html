                    <p>The Tomb of Avicenna covers an area of about 3050 square meters; this place is well-known due to its glorious architecture.
                       The height of its tower reached 28 meters. This monumental structure enjoys specific architectural styles, including ancient Iran and post-Islamic architecture; in other 
                       words, it displays the traditional elements of ancient Iran’s architecture.The Mausoleum of Avicenna (Persian: آرامگاه بوعلی‌سینا) is a monumental complex located at Avicenna Square, Hamadan, Iran.
                       Dedicated to the Persian polymath Avicenna, the complex includes a library, a small museum, and a spindle-shaped tower inspired by the Ziyarid-era Kavus 
                       Tower.Designed by Hooshang Seyhoun, it was built in 1952, replacing an older building dedicated to Avicenna which was destroyed in 1950.
                       The Pahlavi government had plans to build the mausoleum since at least 1939. The mausoleum was eventually dedicated in a grand ceremony in May 1954, and the avenue running in front of it was also renamed in honor of Avicenna.[2]
                       As the monument was a central element of the propagation of Iranian nationalism by the Pahlavi government, it was consequently in danger of being defaced, but as Khomeini himself was an admirer of Avicenna, the square was not renamed after the 1979 Revolution.
